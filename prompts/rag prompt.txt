- The codebase here is a rag system for a generative AI 
- It has a specialised dataset on local council data in a vector database that it retrieves 
- It is going to be called by a mobile applicaion so that users can query the AI about the council data
- I'm building a rag system for a generative AI
- I'm going to use python with Django to build the web service
- I'm using langchain to chunk the data
- I'm using open ai to do embeddings
- I'm using pinecone for vector database (free tier)
- PostgreSQL for a relational database
- I'm using amazon web services aws elastic beanstalk for web hosting (free tier)

Notes:
- Whenever you give me code, give me the entire file, don't abbreviate
- Don't leave comments in the code, except for a single comment at the top of the file stating the file path, such as this: 
    - # File: open_party_rag/rag_app/views.py
- Before you give the code, give an explanation of the problem and your solution

- i have an android app that i am using and it has a command line for users to type questions 
- When the user types a question, I want the question to go to a generative ai that is trained on a specific dataset 
- To do this, I have created this codebase
- The plan is to pass in text, have it translated to embeddings and stored in te vector database so a generative ai can be run on the specialised information 
- How do I do this?
